organization. Leave Application and management portal focuses on
providing a one-stop platform to apply leaves by the employees and

The Portal not only provides the functionality to apply for leave, but it also
manages other important functionalities of the HR. <AD authentication>
provides the required security to the portal. The authentication enables a
different login page for HR and for employees.

of an employee, he/she are denied access to the HR functionalities. The
functionalities of HR are uploading holiday list, introducing a new employee to
the organization, uploading new projects of the organization and to manage
leaves of the employees.

leave history.
